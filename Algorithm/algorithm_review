About algorithm:

1\ sort:
	insertion bubble selection
	quick merge heap

    improvement: 3way quicksort for duplicate items, iteration merge sort, mergesort already sort    
    complexity: quicksort O(1) space, not stable
    			mergesort O(N) space, stable
    			heapsort O(1) space, not stable
    complexity analysis: quicksort and mergesort
    
2\ Graph:
	2.1 Undirected Graph	
		BFS(path) DFS(connected component)
	2.2 Directed Graph
		Cycle_detection Topological_order(BFS, DFS)
	2.3 Undirected Weighted Graph
		Min_spanning_tree
	2.4 Directed Weighted Graph
		Min_path
		
3\ map:
	3.1 binary search tree
		insert, delete, query, rank
	3.2 hash table	
		collision_dealing
